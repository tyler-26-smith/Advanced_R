```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Function calls

Here's a simple example of a function to illustrate how memory operates similarly inside and outside of functions:

```{r functions}
f <- function(a) {
  a
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")

z <- f(x)
# there's no copy here!

untracemem(x)
```

While `f()` is running, the `a` inside the function points to the same value as the `x` does outside the function:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../diagrams/name-value/binding-f1.png")
```

The function `f()` is depicted by the yellow object on the right. It has a formal argument, `a`, which becomes a binding (indicated by dotted black line) in the execution environment (the gray box) when the function is run.

Once `f()` completes, `x` and `z` will point to the same object. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../diagrams/name-value/binding-f2.png")
```

The object never gets copied because it never gets modified. If `f()` did modify `x`, R would create a new copy, and then `z` would bind that object.

```{r functions2}
f <- function(a) {
  a[[1]] <- 2
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
tracemem(x)

z <- f(x)
# x gets copied here

untracemem(x)
```
